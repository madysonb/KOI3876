@article{Fabrycky:2007ys,
	abstract = {At least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binary stars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation: (1) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the main sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few stellar radii away, and (2) in current theories of planet formation, the region within ~0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass planet to form, yet many ``hot Jupiters'' are observed at such distances. We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1-10 days, with a median of ~2 days, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 to ~105 days), consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40$\,^{\circ}$ and 140$\,^{\circ}$. (2) Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star.  This work is dedicated to the late Bohdan Paczynski, who inspired it.},

@article{Lepine:2007fk,
	abstract = {The current classification system of M stars on the main sequence distinguishes three metallicity classes (dwarfs: dM; subdwarfs: sdM; and extreme subdwarfs: esdM). The spectroscopic definition of these classes is based on the relative strength of prominent CaH and TiO molecular absorption bands near 7000 {\AA}, as quantified by three spectroscopic indices (CaH2, CaH3, and TiO5). The boundaries between the metallicity classes were initially defined from a relatively small sample of only 79 metal-poor stars (subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs). We re-examine this classification system in light of our ongoing spectroscopic survey of stars with proper motion mu>0.45'' yr-1, which has increased the census of spectroscopically identified metal-poor M stars to over 400 objects. Kinematic separation of disk dwarfs and halo subdwarfs suggest deficiencies in the current classification system. Observations of common proper motion doubles indicates that the current dM/sdM and sdM/esdM boundaries in the [TiO5, CaH2+CaH3] index plane do not follow isometallicity contours, leaving some binaries inappropriately classified as dM+sdM or sdM+esdM. We propose a revision of the classification system based on an empirical calibration of the TiO/CaH ratio for stars of near solar metallicity. We introduce the parameter zetaTiO/CaH, which quantifies the weakening of the TiO band strength due to metallicity effect, with values ranging from zetaTiO/CaH=1 for stars of near-solar metallicity to zetaTiO/CaH~=0 for the most metal-poor (and TiO depleted) subdwarfs. We redefine the metallicity classes based on the value of the parameter zetaTiO/CaH and refine the scheme by introducing an additional class of ultrasubdwarfs (usdM). We introduce sequences of sdM, esdM, and usdM stars to be used as formal classification standards.  Based on observations conducted at the MDM observatory, operated jointly by the University of Michigan, Dartmouth College, Ohio State University, Columbia University, and the University of Ohio.  Based on observations conducted at the Lick Observatory, operated by the University of California system.},

@article{Seager:2007fj,
	abstract = {We use new interior models of cold planets to investigate the mass-radius relationships of solid exoplanets, considering planets made primarily of iron, silicates, water, and carbon compounds. We find that the mass-radius relationships for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic functional form that is not a simple power law: log10Rs=k1+1/3log10(Ms)-k2Mk3s for up to Mp~20 MâŠ•, where Ms and Rs are scaled mass and radius values. This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form rho=rho0+cPn. We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5% fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with ~5% uncertainty water ice planets with >~25% water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state. We propose a definition of ``super-Earths'' based on the clear distinction in radii between planets with significant gas envelopes and those without.},
